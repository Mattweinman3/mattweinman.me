      <article>
        <h3>Scuba Diving</h3>
          <p> I got my initial scuba certification in 2007 at the age of 11. From there I proceeded to get my Advanced Open Water Certification in 2012. Scuba Diving has been a passion of mine for almost ten years now and it will be for years to come.</p>
        <h3>Backpacking and Camping</h3>
          <p> I did not grow up in a family were camping or being in nature was very common, however, once in college I started to realize I had a passion for the outdoors. Since being in college I have done a 53 mile backpacking trip on a Pennsylvanian stretch of the Appalachian Trail and founded a major campus wide Outdoors Club.</p>
        <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
          <p>After my football and baseball careers ended in high school due to injuries, I took up rock climbing. Climbing is a great way for me to stay in shape (physically and mentally), as well as a way for me to, once again, have the outdoors as an important part of my life.</p>
